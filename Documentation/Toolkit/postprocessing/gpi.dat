-------------------------------Purface--------------------------------
This code calculates generalised plasmonicity index, induced charge density, induced potential, enhanced field as a postprocessing activity for a timedependent GPAW calculation for LCAO basis. 
The GPI can be considered as a measure of how plasmonic a excitation is in a excitated state simulation. The code also prints out the induced charge density, induced potential and field enhancement.

----------------------------Dependencies------------------------------

The code requires .gpw file in occupied - unoccupied basis as printed out from kohn-sham decomposition calculation of GPAW. It requires .ULM of the frequency dependent density matrix as printed out from frequency density matrix calculation of GPAW.

where 0.001 is intensity of the delta kick in x direction. 0.000 is the intensity of the delta kick in y direction. 0.0000 is the intensity of the delta kick in z direction.
The GPI's would be printed in gpi.out file. The induced charge density, induced potential, and enhanced field would be printed in CUBE format.
