---------------------------Purpose-----------------------------------
-This tool  calculates  cube files containing  the transition densities at the input frequencies (wmin to wmax) from the ground state KS wavefunctions in cube format stored in path <fpref> and the frequency or time  dependent density matrix read from "dmatw.dat" or "dmat.dat" as calculated from the Kohn Sham Decomposition tool in the working directory. The list of available frequencies or time steps as well as the list of occupied and unoccupied states
   are read from "dmatw.dat" or "dmat.dat". 
   Optionally, 
    (a) the script also computes the total transition density over frequencies in the range
        wmin to wmax. This option is activated by the switch "-i" at the end of the argument list.
    (b) the script computes the contribution to the transition density from the iocc --> iuocc 
            excitation. This option is activated by the switch "-s" followed by the values of iocc and iuocc.
    (c) the script instructs the cubehandler routines to convert cube file data to bohr from angstroms.
        This option is activated by the switch "-a"
        (d) the script prints (first order) induced density at every time step with frequency specified by a 
            number after the switch -pe
   The three switches, when used, should appear after the path of the cube files (fpref), range of frequencies
   (wmin and wmax) are specified. Their order of appearance does not matter.


---------------------------Dependencies----------------------------

This calculation requires trans_density.py and cubehandler.py. Also the  dmatw.dat or dmat.dat files as computed from the Kohn Sham decomposition tool is needed for calculating the frequency or time dependent transition densities.
